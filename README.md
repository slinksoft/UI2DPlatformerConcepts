# UI 2D Platformer Concepts with C# and Winforms
Very alpha 2D platformer concepts using UI Designer (Winforms) and C#


Freshman year of college, I attempted to make a SMB clone from scratch. Doing this proved to be challenging, but I didn't give up. I wanted to at least make concepts, just like I did with my Zelda NES concept and Project VOTD. I used C# and Winforms UI to create the following concepts.

Below is the original, old project. It is more complete, with the mushroom, fire flower, and a goomba that you can stomp. However, the animation is bad, and the collision is wonky. Mario would slip close to platforms and collide too much into objects.

Getting the fire flower:

Fast foward to today, I was bored in one of my classes (it isn't an important class and the professor is chill, don't worry, lol) and I opened up VS 2019 and started messing around with Winforms. Below is another attempt at a 2D platformer concept, with better collision and animation, but less complete. Mario no longer slides off edges of platforms, he doesn't collide into objects/walls/floors as badly as the original concept, and the animation is a bit better and more controlled:

If I ever decide to make a 2D platformer, it will be developed in a game engine, such as Game Maker Studio or Unity. The code is shown is to give the idea that while it is impressive developing game elements from scratch, there are many useful resources out on the Internet that focus strictly on game development, such as Game Maker Studio, Unity, or Unreal Engine.

With the idea of creating game elements from scratch, 2D overworld games like Zelda are much easier to make versus 2D platformers. My reasonings behind this is the following:
- You have to deal with gravity in your environment
- More animation (coding wise) needs to be done (idle left, idle right, move left, move right, and then making sure correct animations/sprites play when jumping and landing)
- Collision work is more complicated due to dealing with gravity

versus 2D overworld games:
- You don't have to deal with gravity
- Collision is much easier without gravity
- Animation is more simple (up, down, left, right, idle, and whatever else that applies with your project)

Moral of the story: GRAVITY COMPLICATES A LOT OF THINGS!!!

Anyways, I had fun with these concepts. One day, I might drop my Zelda concept source, but it is a bit messy...

These concepts are not perfect whatsoever, and can be greatly improved. I am not the best programmer, so, ... yeah.

I have more important things to focus on, such as my academic studies and other projects that I feel have importance to them, which is why I do not want to continue development on these concepts. Again, I will use a game engine if I decide to make a 2D platformer.
